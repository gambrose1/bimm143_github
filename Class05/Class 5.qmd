## Background

There are lots of ways to make figures in R. These include so-called "base R" graphics (e.g. `plot()`) and tons of add-on packages like **ggplot2**.

For example, here we make the same plot with both:

```{r}
head(cars)

plot(cars)
```

First, I need to install the package with the command `install.packages()`.

>**NB** We never run an installl cmd in a quartro code chunk or we will end up re-installing packages many, many times - which is not what we want!

Every time we want to use one of these "add-ons" packages, we need to load it up with the `library()` function.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(cars)
```

Every ggplot needs at least 3 things:

- The **data**, the stuff you want plotted
- The **aes**thitics, , how the data map to the plot
- The **geom**etry, the type of plot

```{r}
ggplot(cars) +
  aes(x = speed, y = dist) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```
